# 28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String

Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Example 1:
```
Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104
* haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.

# 344. Reverse String

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= s.length <= 105
* s[i] is a printable ascii character.

# 443. String Compression
Given an array of characters chars, compress it using the following algorithm:

Begin with an empty string s. For each group of consecutive repeating characters in chars:

If the group's length is 1, append the character to s.
Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.
The compressed string s should not be returned separately, but instead, be stored in the input character array chars. Note that group lengths that are 10 or longer will be split into multiple characters in chars.

After you are done modifying the input array, return the new length of the array.

You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.


Example 1:
```
Input: chars = ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
Output: Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]
Explanation: The groups are "aa", "bb", and "ccc". This compresses to "a2b2c3".
```
Example 2:
```
Input: chars = ["a"]
Output: Return 1, and the first character of the input array should be: ["a"]
Explanation: The only group is "a", which remains uncompressed since it's a single character.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: chars = ["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]
Output: Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].
Explanation: The groups are "a" and "bbbbbbbbbbbb". This compresses to "ab12".
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= chars.length <= 2000
* chars[i] is a lowercase English letter, uppercase English letter, digit, or symbol.
# 76. Minimum Window Substring

Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window
substring
of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.


Example 1:
```
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
```

Constraints:

* m == s.length
* n == t.length
* 1 <= m, n <= 105
* s and t consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

# Word Pattern
Given a pattern and a string s, find if s follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in s.


Example 1:
```
Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat fish"
Output: false
```
Example 3:
```
Input: pattern = "aaaa", s = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: false
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= pattern.length <= 300
* pattern contains only lower-case English letters.
* 1 <= s.length <= 3000
* s contains only lowercase English letters and spaces ' '.
* s does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.
* All the words in s are separated by a single space.

# 72. Edit Distance
Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

Insert a character
Delete a character
Replace a character


Example 1:
```
Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation:
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
```

Example 2:
```

Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation:
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')
```

Constraints:

* 0 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500
* word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.

# 647. Palindromic Substrings

Given a string s, return the number of palindromic substrings in it.

A string is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= s.length <= 1000
* s consists of lowercase English letters.

# 131. Palindrome Partitioning
Given a string s, partition s such that every
substring
of the partition is a
palindrome
. Return all possible palindrome partitioning of s.


Example 1:
```
Input: s = "aab"
Output: [["a","a","b"],["aa","b"]]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "a"
Output: [["a"]]
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= s.length <= 16
* s contains only lowercase English letters.
# 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement

You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most k times.

Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.



Example 1:
```
Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
```

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of only uppercase English letters.
0 <= k <= s.length

# 152. Maximum Product Subarray

Given an integer array nums, find a
subarray
that has the largest product, and return the product.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.



Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
- -10 <= nums[i] <= 10
- The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

# 49. Group Anagrams

Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.



Example 1:
```
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]
```
Example 3:
```
Input: strs = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= strs.length <= 104
- 0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
- strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

# 242. Valid Anagram
Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.



Example 1:
```
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 104
- s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

# 205. Isomorphic Strings

Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.


Example 1:
```
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
```
Example 3:
```
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true
```
