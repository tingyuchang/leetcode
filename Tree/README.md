# 226. Invert Binary Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.


Example 1:
![]()
```
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]
Output: [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]
```
Example 2:
![]()
```
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [2,3,1]
```
Example 3:
```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```
Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100

# 94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal
Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Example 1:

Output: [1,3,2]
Example 2:

Input: root = []
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]


Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100

# 783. Minimum Distance Between BST Nodes
