# 94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal
Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/15/inorder_1.jpg)

Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
Example 2:

Input: root = []
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]


Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100

# 783. Minimum Distance Between BST Nodes
# 530. Minimum Absolute Difference in BST

Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), return the minimum absolute difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.

Input: root = [1,0,48,null,null,12,49]
Output: 1
```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 104].
- 0 <= Node.val <= 105
