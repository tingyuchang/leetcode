# 213. House Robber II
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 3
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= nums.length <= 100
* 0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
# 198. House Robber
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
```
Constraints:
* 1 <= nums.length <= 100
* 0 <= nums[i] <= 400


# 216. Combination Sum III
Find all valid combinations of k numbers that sum up to n such that the following conditions are true:

Only numbers 1 through 9 are used.
Each number is used at most once.
Return a list of all possible valid combinations. The list must not contain the same combination twice, and the combinations may be returned in any order.



Example 1:
```
Input: k = 3, n = 7
Output: [[1,2,4]]
Explanation:
1 + 2 + 4 = 7
There are no other valid combinations.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: k = 3, n = 9
Output: [[1,2,6],[1,3,5],[2,3,4]]
Explanation:
1 + 2 + 6 = 9
1 + 3 + 5 = 9
2 + 3 + 4 = 9
There are no other valid combinations.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: k = 4, n = 1
Output: []
Explanation: There are no valid combinations.
Using 4 different numbers in the range [1,9], the smallest sum we can get is 1+2+3+4 = 10 and since 10 > 1, there are no valid combination.
```

Constraints:

* 2 <= k <= 9
* 1 <= n <= 60

# 40. Combination Sum II

Given a collection of candidate numbers (candidates) and a target number (target), find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sum to target.

Each number in candidates may only be used once in the combination.

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

Example 1:
```
Input: candidates = [10,1,2,7,6,1,5], target = 8
Output:
[
[1,1,6],
[1,2,5],
[1,7],
[2,6]
]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: candidates = [2,5,2,1,2], target = 5
Output:
[
[1,2,2],
[5]
]
```
Constraints:

* 1 <= candidates.length <= 100
* 1 <= candidates[i] <= 50
* 1 <= target <= 30

# 377. Combination Sum IV
Given an array of distinct integers nums and a target integer target, return the number of possible combinations that add up to target.

The test cases are generated so that the answer can fit in a 32-bit integer.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3], target = 4
Output: 7
Explanation:
The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)
Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [9], target = 3
Output: 0
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= nums.length <= 200
* 1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
* All the elements of nums are unique.
* 1 <= target <= 1000

# 1143. Longest Common Subsequence
Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

Example 1:
```
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000
* text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters.
# 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence

Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing
subsequence
.
Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4
```
Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= nums.length <= 2500
* -104 <= nums[i] <= 104

Follow up: Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in O(n log(n)) time complexity?

# 322. Coin Change
You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.

Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.


Example 1:
```
Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
```
Example 2:
```
Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1
```
Example 3:
```
Input: coins = [1], amount = 0
Output: 0
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= coins.length <= 12
* 1 <= coins[i] <= 231 - 1
* 0 <= amount <= 104

# 70. Climbing Stairs
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```
Example 2:
```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```
Constraints:
* 1 <= n <= 45
# 502. IPO

Suppose LeetCode will start its IPO soon. In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the IPO. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most k distinct projects before the IPO. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most k distinct projects.

You are given n projects where the ith project has a pure profit profits[i] and a minimum capital of capital[i] is needed to start it.

Initially, you have w capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.

Pick a list of at most k distinct projects from given projects to maximize your final capital, and return the final maximized capital.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.



Example 1:
```
Input: k = 2, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.
After finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.
With capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.
Since you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.
Therefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: k = 3, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,2]
Output: 6
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= k <= 105
* 0 <= w <= 109
* n == profits.length
* n == capital.length
* 1 <= n <= 105
* 0 <= profits[i] <= 104
* 0 <= capital[i] <= 109
