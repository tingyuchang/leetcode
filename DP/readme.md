# 837. New 21 Game

Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21".

Alice starts with 0 points and draws numbers while she has less than k points. During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range [1, maxPts], where maxPts is an integer. Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.

Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets k or more points.

Return the probability that Alice has n or fewer points.

Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer are considered accepted.

Example 1:

```
Input: n = 10, k = 1, maxPts = 10
Output: 1.00000
Explanation: Alice gets a single card, then stops.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: n = 6, k = 1, maxPts = 10
Output: 0.60000
Explanation: Alice gets a single card, then stops.
In 6 out of 10 possibilities, she is at or below 6 points.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: n = 21, k = 17, maxPts = 10
Output: 0.73278
```

Constraints:

0 <= k <= n <= 104
1 <= maxPts <= 104

# 2466. Count Ways To Build Good Strings

Given the integers zero, one, low, and high, we can construct a string by starting with an empty string, and then at each step perform either of the following:

Append the character '0' zero times.
Append the character '1' one times.
This can be performed any number of times.

A good string is a string constructed by the above process having a length between low and high (inclusive).

Return the number of different good strings that can be constructed satisfying these properties. Since the answer can be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.


Example 1:

```
Input: low = 3, high = 3, zero = 1, one = 1
Output: 8
Explanation:
One possible valid good string is "011".
It can be constructed as follows: "" -> "0" -> "01" -> "011".
All binary strings from "000" to "111" are good strings in this example.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: low = 2, high = 3, zero = 1, one = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: The good strings are "00", "11", "000", "110", and "011".
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= low <= high <= 105
* 1 <= zero, one <= low


# 2140. Solving Questions With Brainpower

You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array questions where questions[i] = [pointsi, brainpoweri].

The array describes the questions of an exam, where you have to process the questions in order (i.e., starting from question 0) and make a decision whether to solve or skip each question. Solving question i will earn you pointsi points but you will be unable to solve each of the next brainpoweri questions. If you skip question i, you get to make the decision on the next question.

For example, given questions = [[3, 2], [4, 3], [4, 4], [2, 5]]:
If question 0 is solved, you will earn 3 points but you will be unable to solve questions 1 and 2.
If instead, question 0 is skipped and question 1 is solved, you will earn 4 points but you will be unable to solve questions 2 and 3.
Return the maximum points you can earn for the exam.

Example 1:

```
Input: questions = [[3,2],[4,3],[4,4],[2,5]]
Output: 5
Explanation: The maximum points can be earned by solving questions 0 and 3.
- Solve question 0: Earn 3 points, will be unable to solve the next 2 questions
- Unable to solve questions 1 and 2
- Solve question 3: Earn 2 points
  Total points earned: 3 + 2 = 5. There is no other way to earn 5 or more points.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: questions = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4],[5,5]]
Output: 7
Explanation: The maximum points can be earned by solving questions 1 and 4.
- Skip question 0
- Solve question 1: Earn 2 points, will be unable to solve the next 2 questions
- Unable to solve questions 2 and 3
- Solve question 4: Earn 5 points
  Total points earned: 2 + 5 = 7. There is no other way to earn 7 or more points.
```

Constraints:

1 <= questions.length <= 105
questions[i].length == 2
1 <= pointsi, brainpoweri <= 105


# 1035. Uncrossed Lines

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2. We write the integers of nums1 and nums2 (in the order they are given) on two separate horizontal lines.

We may draw connecting lines: a straight line connecting two numbers nums1[i] and nums2[j] such that:

nums1[i] == nums2[j], and
the line we draw does not intersect any other connecting (non-horizontal) line.
Note that a connecting line cannot intersect even at the endpoints (i.e., each number can only belong to one connecting line).

Return the maximum number of connecting lines we can draw in this way.



Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/04/26/142.png)
```
Input: nums1 = [1,4,2], nums2 = [1,2,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: We can draw 2 uncrossed lines as in the diagram.
We cannot draw 3 uncrossed lines, because the line from nums1[1] = 4 to nums2[2] = 4 will intersect the line from nums1[2]=2 to nums2[1]=2.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums1 = [2,5,1,2,5], nums2 = [10,5,2,1,5,2]

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [3,5,6,7], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 subsequences that satisfy the condition.
[3] -> Min value + max value <= target (3 + 3 <= 9)
[3,5] -> (3 + 5 <= 9)
[3,5,6] -> (3 + 6 <= 9)
[3,6] -> (3 + 6 <= 9)
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [3,3,6,8], target = 10
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 subsequences that satisfy the condition. (nums can have repeated numbers).
[3] , [3] , [3,3], [3,6] , [3,6] , [3,3,6]
```
Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [2,3,3,4,6,7], target = 12
Output: 61
Explanation: There are 63 non-empty subsequences, two of them do not satisfy the condition ([6,7], [7]).
Number of valid subsequences (63 - 2 = 61).

```
Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: The length of the longest increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 increasing subsequences of length 1, so output 5.
```

* -106 <= nums[i] <= 106

# 115. Distinct Subsequences

Given two strings s and t, return the number of distinct
subsequences

# 712. Minimum ASCII Delete Sum for Two Strings

Given two strings s1 and s2, return the lowest ASCII sum of deleted characters to make two strings equal.

Example 1:

```
Input: s1 = "sea", s2 = "eat"
Output: 231
Explanation: Deleting "s" from "sea" adds the ASCII value of "s" (115) to the sum.
Deleting "t" from "eat" adds 116 to the sum.
At the end, both strings are equal, and 115 + 116 = 231 is the minimum sum possible to achieve this.
```
Example 2:

```
Input: s1 = "delete", s2 = "leet"
Output: 403
Explanation: Deleting "dee" from "delete" to turn the string into "let",
adds 100[d] + 101[e] + 101[e] to the sum.
Deleting "e" from "leet" adds 101[e] to the sum.
At the end, both strings are equal to "let", and the answer is 100+101+101+101 = 403.
If instead we turned both strings into "lee" or "eet", we would get answers of 433 or 417, which are higher.
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 1000
* s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters.

# 879. Profitable Schemes

There is a group of n members, and a list of various crimes they could commit. The ith crime generates a profit[i] and requires group[i] members to participate in it. If a member participates in one crime, that member can't participate in another crime.

Let's call a profitable scheme any subset of these crimes that generates at least minProfit profit, and the total number of members participating in that subset of crimes is at most n.

Return the number of schemes that can be chosen. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

# 1639. Number of Ways to Form a Target String Given a Dictionary

You are given a list of strings of the same length words and a string target.

Your task is to form target using the given words under the following rules:

target should be formed from left to right.
To form the ith character (0-indexed) of target, you can choose the kth character of the jth string in words if target[i] = words[j][k].
Once you use the kth character of the jth string of words, you can no longer use the xth character of any string in words where x <= k. In other words, all characters to the left of or at index k become unusuable for every string.
Repeat the process until you form the string target.
Notice that you can use multiple characters from the same string in words provided the conditions above are met.

Return the number of ways to form target from words. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Example 1:

"bab" -> index 0 ("baab"), index 1 ("baab"), index 2 ("abba")
"bab" -> index 0 ("baab"), index 1 ("baab"), index 3 ("baab")
"bab" -> index 0 ("baab"), index 2 ("baab"), index 3 ("baab")

Return the minimum number of substrings in such a partition.

Note that each character should belong to exactly one substring in a partition.


Example 1:

```
Input: s = "abacaba"
Output: 4
Explanation:
Two possible partitions are ("a","ba","cab","a") and ("ab","a","ca","ba").
It can be shown that 4 is the minimum number of substrings needed.
```

Output: 6
Explanation:
The only valid partition is ("s","s","s","s","s","s").
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= s.length <= 105
* s consists of only English lowercase letters.

# 87. Scramble String

We can scramble a string s to get a string t using the following algorithm:

If the length of the string is 1, stop.
If the length of the string is > 1, do the following:
Split the string into two non-empty substrings at a random index, i.e., if the string is s, divide it to x and y where s = x + y.
Randomly decide to swap the two substrings or to keep them in the same order. i.e., after this step, s may become s = x + y or s = y + x.
Apply step 1 recursively on each of the two substrings x and y.
Given two strings s1 and s2 of the same length, return true if s2 is a scrambled string of s1, otherwise, return false.


Example 1:

```
Input: s1 = "great", s2 = "rgeat"
Output: true
Explanation: One possible scenario applied on s1 is:
"great" --> "gr/eat" // divide at random index.
"gr/eat" --> "gr/eat" // random decision is not to swap the two substrings and keep them in order.
"gr/eat" --> "g/r / e/at" // apply the same algorithm recursively on both substrings. divide at random index each of them.
"g/r / e/at" --> "r/g / e/at" // random decision was to swap the first substring and to keep the second substring in the same order.
"r/g / e/at" --> "r/g / e/ a/t" // again apply the algorithm recursively, divide "at" to "a/t".
"r/g / e/ a/t" --> "r/g / e/ a/t" // random decision is to keep both substrings in the same order.
The algorithm stops now, and the result string is "rgeat" which is s2.
As one possible scenario led s1 to be scrambled to s2, we return true.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s1 = "abcde", s2 = "caebd"
Output: false
```
Example 3:
```
Input: s1 = "a", s2 = "a"
Output: true
```

Constraints:

* s1.length == s2.length
* 1 <= s1.length <= 30
* s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters.

# 1402. Reducing Dishes

A chef has collected data on the satisfaction level of his n dishes. Chef can cook any dish in 1 unit of time.

Like-time coefficient of a dish is defined as the time taken to cook that dish including previous dishes multiplied by its satisfaction level i.e. time[i] * satisfaction[i].

Return the maximum sum of like-time coefficient that the chef can obtain after dishes preparation.

Dishes can be prepared in any order and the chef can discard some dishes to get this maximum value.

* a 30-day pass is sold for costs[2] dollars.
* The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.

For example, if we get a 7-day pass on day 2, then we can travel for 7 days: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
Return the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of days.



Example 1:

```
Input: days = [1,4,6,7,8,20], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 11
Explanation: For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 1.
On day 3, you bought a 7-day pass for costs[1] = $7, which covered days 3, 4, ..., 9.
On day 20, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 20.
In total, you spent $11 and covered all the days of your travel.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: days = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,30,31], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 17
Explanation: For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 30-day pass for costs[2] = $15 which covered days 1, 2, ..., 30.
On day 31, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2 which covered day 31.
In total, you spent $17 and covered all the days of your travel.

# 1143. Longest Common Subsequence
Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

# 502. IPO

Suppose LeetCode will start its IPO soon. In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the IPO. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most k distinct projects before the IPO. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most k distinct projects.

You are given n projects where the ith project has a pure profit profits[i] and a minimum capital of capital[i] is needed to start it.

Initially, you have w capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.

Pick a list of at most k distinct projects from given projects to maximize your final capital, and return the final maximized capital.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.



Example 1:
```
Input: k = 2, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.
After finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.
With capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.
Since you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.
Therefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: k = 3, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,2]
Output: 6
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= k <= 105
* 0 <= w <= 109
* n == profits.length
* n == capital.length
* 1 <= n <= 105
* 0 <= profits[i] <= 104
* 0 <= capital[i] <= 109
