# 142. Linked List Cycle II
Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to (0-indexed). It is -1 if there is no cycle. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Do not modify the linked list.



Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png)

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```
Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)
```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```
Example 3:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)
```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```
Constraints:

* The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104].
* -105 <= Node.val <= 105
* pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.


# 143. Reorder List

You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln
Reorder the list to be on the following form:

L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …
You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.


Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/04/reorder1linked-list.jpg)
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,4,2,3]
```
Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/09/reorder2-linked-list.jpg)
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,5,2,4,3]
```

Constraints:

* The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 5 * 104].
* 1 <= Node.val <= 1000

# 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/merge_ex1.jpg)
```
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []
```
Example 3:
```
Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

Constraints:

* The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
* -100 <= Node.val <= 100
* Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
