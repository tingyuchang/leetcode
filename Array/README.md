# 2215. Find the Difference of Two Arrays

Given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return a list answer of size 2 where:

answer[0] is a list of all distinct integers in nums1 which are not present in nums2.
answer[1] is a list of all distinct integers in nums2 which are not present in nums1.
Note that the integers in the lists may be returned in any order.


Example 1:


```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3], nums2 = [2,4,6]
Output: [[1,3],[4,6]]
Explanation:
For nums1, nums1[1] = 2 is present at index 0 of nums2, whereas nums1[0] = 1 and nums1[2] = 3 are not present in nums2. Therefore, answer[0] = [1,3].
For nums2, nums2[0] = 2 is present at index 1 of nums1, whereas nums2[1] = 4 and nums2[2] = 6 are not present in nums2. Therefore, answer[1] = [4,6].
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,3], nums2 = [1,1,2,2]
Output: [[3],[]]
Explanation:
For nums1, nums1[2] and nums1[3] are not present in nums2. Since nums1[2] == nums1[3], their value is only included once and answer[0] = [3].
Every integer in nums2 is present in nums1. Therefore, answer[1] = [].
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000
* -1000 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000

# 42. Trapping Rain Water

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

Example 1:

```
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
```
Example 2:

```
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
```

Constraints:

* n == height.length
* 1 <= n <= 2 * 104
* 0 <= height[i] <= 105

# 209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum

Given an array of positive integers nums and a positive integer target, return the minimal length of a
subarray
whose sum is greater than or equal to target. If there is no such subarray, return 0 instead.


Example 1:

```
Input: target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: The subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: target = 4, nums = [1,4,4]
Output: 1
```
Example 3:
```
Input: target = 11, nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Output: 0
```

Constraints:

1 <= target <= 109
1 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 104

# 1046. Last Stone Weight

You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone.

We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose the heaviest two stones and smash them together. Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights x and y with x <= y. The result of this smash is:

If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and
If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x.
At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.

Return the weight of the last remaining stone. If there are no stones left, return 0.

Example 1:

```
Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value of the last stone.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: stones = [1]
Output: 1
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= stones.length <= 30
* 1 <= stones[i] <= 1000

# 1416. Restore The Array

A program was supposed to print an array of integers. The program forgot to print whitespaces and the array is printed as a string of digits s and all we know is that all integers in the array were in the range [1, k] and there are no leading zeros in the array.

Given the string s and the integer k, return the number of the possible arrays that can be printed as s using the mentioned program. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Example 1:

```
Input: s = "1000", k = 10000
Output: 1
Explanation: The only possible array is [1000]
```
Example 2:

```
Input: s = "1000", k = 10
Output: 0
Explanation: There cannot be an array that was printed this way and has all integer >= 1 and <= 10.
```
Example 3:

```
Input: s = "1317", k = 2000
Output: 8
Explanation: Possible arrays are [1317],[131,7],[13,17],[1,317],[13,1,7],[1,31,7],[1,3,17],[1,3,1,7]
```

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of only digits and does not contain leading zeros.
1 <= k <= 109

# 1431. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies

There are n kids with candies. You are given an integer array candies, where each candies[i] represents the number of candies the ith kid has, and an integer extraCandies, denoting the number of extra candies that you have.

Return a boolean array result of length n, where result[i] is true if, after giving the ith kid all the extraCandies, they will have the greatest number of candies among all the kids, or false otherwise.

Note that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.

Example 1:


```
Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
Output: [true,true,true,false,true]
Explanation: If you give all extraCandies to:
- Kid 1, they will have 2 + 3 = 5 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 2, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 3, they will have 5 + 3 = 8 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 4, they will have 1 + 3 = 4 candies, which is not the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 5, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
```
Example 2:

```
Input: candies = [4,2,1,1,2], extraCandies = 1
Output: [true,false,false,false,false]
Explanation: There is only 1 extra candy.
Kid 1 will always have the greatest number of candies, even if a different kid is given the extra candy.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: candies = [12,1,12], extraCandies = 10
Output: [true,false,true]
```

Constraints:

n == candies.length
2 <= n <= 100
1 <= candies[i] <= 100
1 <= extraCandies <= 50

# 844. Backspace String Compare

Given two strings s and t, return true if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. '#' means a backspace character.

Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.

Example 1:

```
Input: s = "ab#c", t = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "ac".
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "ab##", t = "c#d#"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "".
```
Example 3:
```
Input: s = "a#c", t = "b"
Output: false
Explanation: s becomes "c" while t becomes "b".
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 200
* s and t only contain lowercase letters and '#' characters.

# 946. Validate Stack Sequences

Given two integer arrays pushed and popped each with distinct values, return true if this could have been the result of a sequence of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack, or false otherwise.

Example 1:

```
Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,5,3,2,1]
Output: true
Explanation: We might do the following sequence:
push(1), push(2), push(3), push(4),
pop() -> 4,
push(5),
pop() -> 5, pop() -> 3, pop() -> 2, pop() -> 1
```

Example 2:

```
Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,3,5,1,2]
Output: false
Explanation: 1 cannot be popped before 2.
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= pushed.length <= 1000
* 0 <= pushed[i] <= 1000
* All the elements of pushed are unique.
* popped.length == pushed.length
* popped is a permutation of pushed.

# # 503. Next Greater Element II

Given a positive integer n, find the smallest integer which has exactly the same digits existing in the integer n and is greater in value than n. If no such positive integer exists, return -1.

Note that the returned integer should fit in 32-bit integer, if there is a valid answer but it does not fit in 32-bit integer, return -1.

Example 1:

```
Input: n = 12
Output: 21
```
Example 2:
```
Input: n = 21
Output: -1
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= n <= 231 - 1

# 503. Next Greater Element II

Given a circular integer array nums (i.e., the next element of nums[nums.length - 1] is nums[0]), return the next greater number for every element in nums.

The next greater number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, return -1 for this number.


Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1]
Output: [2,-1,2]
Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2;
The number 2 can't find next greater number.
The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,3]
Output: [2,3,4,-1,4]
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= nums.length <= 104
* -109 <= nums[i] <= 109

# 496. Next Greater Element I

The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array.

You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.

For each 0 <= i < nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1.

Return an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
```
Example 2:

```
Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= nums1.length <= nums2.length <= 1000
* 0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 104
* All integers in nums1 and nums2 are unique.
* All the integers of nums1 also appear in nums2.
*
