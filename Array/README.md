# 496. Next Greater Element I

The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array.

You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.

For each 0 <= i < nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1.

Return an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
```
Example 2:

```
Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= nums1.length <= nums2.length <= 1000
* 0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 104
* All integers in nums1 and nums2 are unique.
* All the integers of nums1 also appear in nums2.
*

# 219. Contains Duplicate II

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return true if there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that nums[i] == nums[j] and abs(i - j) <= k.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1
Output: true
```
Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3], k = 2
Output: false
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
- 0 <= k <= 105

# 217. Contains Duplicate

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
```
Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
