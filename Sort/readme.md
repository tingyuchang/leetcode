# 977. Squares of a Sorted Array

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.


Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].
```
Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= nums.length <= 104
* -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
* nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.


Follow up: Squaring each element and sorting the new array is very trivial, could you find an O(n) solution using a different approach?


# 80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove some duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears at most twice. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums. More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.

Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.

Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:
```
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
```
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.



Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
Output: 5, nums = [1,1,2,2,3,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3]
Output: 7, nums = [0,0,1,1,2,3,3,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
* -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
* nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.


# 81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II

There is an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order (not necessarily with distinct values).

Before being passed to your function, nums is rotated at an unknown pivot index k (0 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,4,4,5,6,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 5 and become [4,5,6,6,7,0,1,2,4,4].

Given the array nums after the rotation and an integer target, return true if target is in nums, or false if it is not in nums.

You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.



Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: false
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= nums.length <= 5000
* -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
* nums is guaranteed to be rotated at some pivot.
* -104 <= target <= 104


Follow up: This problem is similar to Search in Rotated Sorted Array, but nums may contain duplicates. Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?


# 75. Sort Colors

Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]
```

Constraints:

* n == nums.length
* 1 <= n <= 300
* nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2.

# 31. Next Permutation

A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

For example, for arr = [1,2,3], the following are all the permutations of arr: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].
The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].
While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.
Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.

The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.



Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: [1,2,3]
```
Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,5]
Output: [1,5,1]
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 100
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 100
# 283. Move Zeroes
Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 104
- -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
