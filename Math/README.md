# 15. 3Sum
Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.



Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
Explanation:
nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].
Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [0,1,1]
Output: []
Explanation: The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [0,0,0]
Output: [[0,0,0]]
Explanation: The only possible triplet sums up to 0.
```
# 746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs

You are given an integer array cost where cost[i] is the cost of ith step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.

Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.



Example 1:
```
Input: cost = [10,15,20]
Output: 15
Explanation: You will start at index 1.
- Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.
  The total cost is 15.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: You will start at index 0.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.
  The total cost is 6.
```

Constraints:

- 2 <= cost.length <= 1000
- 0 <= cost[i] <= 999

# 238. Product of Array Except Self

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.



Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
```

Constraints:

- 2 <= nums.length <= 105
- -30 <= nums[i] <= 30
= The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.


Follow up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

# 231. Power of Two
Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of two. Otherwise, return false.

An integer n is a power of two, if there exists an integer x such that n == 2x.

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 20 = 1
```
Example 2:
```
Input: n = 16
Output: true
Explanation: 24 = 16
```
Example 3:
```
Input: n = 3
Output: false
```

Constraints:
- -231 <= n <= 231 - 1

# 1523. Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range

Given two non-negative integers low and high. Return the count of odd numbers between low and high (inclusive).

Example 1:
```
Input: low = 3, high = 7
Output: 3
Explanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].
```
Example 2:
```
Input: low = 8, high = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: The odd numbers between 8 and 10 are [9].
```

Constraints:

- 0 <= low <= high <= 10^9

# 202. Happy Number
Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
```
Example 2:
```
Input: n = 2
Output: false
```
