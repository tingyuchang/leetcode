238. Product of Array Except Self

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.



Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
```

Constraints:

- 2 <= nums.length <= 105
- -30 <= nums[i] <= 30
= The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.


Follow up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

# 231. Power of Two
Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of two. Otherwise, return false.

An integer n is a power of two, if there exists an integer x such that n == 2x.

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 20 = 1
```
Example 2:
```
Input: n = 16
Output: true
Explanation: 24 = 16
```
Example 3:
```
Input: n = 3
Output: false
```

Constraints:
- -231 <= n <= 231 - 1

# 1523. Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range

Given two non-negative integers low and high. Return the count of odd numbers between low and high (inclusive).

Example 1:
```
Input: low = 3, high = 7
Output: 3
Explanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].
```
Example 2:
```
Input: low = 8, high = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: The odd numbers between 8 and 10 are [9].
```

Constraints:

- 0 <= low <= high <= 10^9

# 202. Happy Number
Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
```
Example 2:
```
Input: n = 2
Output: false
```
