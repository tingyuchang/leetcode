# 540. Single Element in a Sorted Array
You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once.

Return the single element that appears only once.

Your solution must run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
Output: 2
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]
Output: 10
 ```

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 105

# 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.



Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times.
```

Constraints:

- n == nums.length
- 1 <= n <= 5000
- -5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
- All the integers of nums are unique.
- nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.

# 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.



Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```
Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 5000
- -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
- All values of nums are unique.
- nums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
- -104 <= target <= 104
